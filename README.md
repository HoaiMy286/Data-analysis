# Data-analysis

In this project, we will start with simple statistical problems from the data provided. Through this, we will discover interesting and meaningful numbers for real-world data by using the R language to analyze data, build multiple linear regression models, make reasonable predictions, and check their accuracy in the most precise way. The results we find will be the starting point for exploring the data resources of the system later, aiming to improve problem-solving skills, programming skills, applying knowledge to related fields, teamwork skills, and aiming for higher goals, such as passion for work, learning, and research.
